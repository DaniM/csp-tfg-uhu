ASP LAB
=======

* ``asp/`` example logic programs taken from pcgbook.com

* ``pyscript/`` collection of python scripts for ascii visualization
of maps given a list of logic facts. They are very coupled to scripts
representation.

	* ``genmaze.py`` early and very tied to representation version of map visualizer

	* ``parfacter.py`` more generic (but still tied) visualizer
